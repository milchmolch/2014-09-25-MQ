    <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> (not to be confused with
    <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a>) is a website that can host
    code: you'll learn about this during the bootcamp.  Please create
    an account by filling in <a href="https://github.com/join">this
    form</a>.  A free account is all you will need, but you
    may <a href="https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new">request
    an education discount/account</a> that will give you a private
    place to host your code.
