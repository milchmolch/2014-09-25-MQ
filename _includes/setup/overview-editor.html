  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
    editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
    like automatic color-coding of key words.  We'll do most of our
    work in <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, but a
    standalone editor will be useful at times during the bootcamp.
